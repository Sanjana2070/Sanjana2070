# About Me
I am an aspiring MS in Computer Science student with 3+ years of experience working on large-scale enterprise systems at Deloitte USI in Risk and Financial Advisory. My work spans Identity and Access Management across Windows applications and Unix servers, where I managed user access, configured IAM roles and entitlements, and resolved technical issues in production environments.
<br />
Alongside industry experience, I have built a portfolio of 25+ projects in Game Development, Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and interactive systems. I am a national hackathon winner and a Southern Asia qualifier in the OpenCV AI Competition, with a growing focus on Computer Vision and Machine Learning to merge movement analysis with technology.

## Selected Projects
<li>Lightweight Motion QA: A browser-based system that answers user queries about human motion in short videos. Combines pose estimation, motion analysis, and an LLM wrapper to provide motion-aware responses.</li>
<li>Future Generali Mixed Reality Application: A combined AR and VR application to improve customer engagement. An interactive and immersive experience for users to explore insurance products and services.</li>
<li>End-to-end AR Retail Interface to enhance in-store shopping experiences. An immersive solution to navigate store, visualize product descriptions, and get ML-based recommendation flows.</li>
<li>Gait Analysis: Computer Vision Solution for an inexpensive, accessible and effective diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease using Gait Analysis. Skeletonization through Background Extraction, Noise Filtering, and Morphological Transformation. Motion-cue extraction using cosine similarity to analyse gait patterns.</li>
<li>COVID Simulation (AR & VR): Educational app simulating real-life scenarios in virtual and augmented environments.</li>
<li>Qwazzy Cupcakes: My playful take on Angry Birds brings physics-based fun with a quirky vibe.</li>
<li>GrassHopper Run: A fast-paced endless runner inspired by Temple Run, designed for quick, addictive gameplay.</li>
